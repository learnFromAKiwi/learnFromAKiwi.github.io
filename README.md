Learn From A Kiwi!

## What is this project about?

As part of the Startup Weekend Aotearoa, Sunny Feng and I contributed to the project by building a MVP for a demo. We built this website in less than 40 hours, using ReactJs. This project will be published at the time of presenting the project, but will be taken down at the conclusion of the event. 

LearnFromAKiwi is a website that allows users to take classes, and our website aims to give it the "human" aspect of taking class online. 

## How do I run the code?

First, clone the repository. Then navigate into the directory, and run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and then `npm start`, which will open up a local host. Currently, as of (02/05/2020), the only working pages are the landing page and sign in page.
